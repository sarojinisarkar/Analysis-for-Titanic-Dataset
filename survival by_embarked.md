## survival based on embarked:
During the analysis of survival rates based on the port of embarkation,
initially observed that the majority of passengers boarded from Southampton. 
despite having the highest number of both survivors (300) and casualties, 
it still had the highest overall survival rate when compared to other embarkation ports.
